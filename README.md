# Image Binarization
This program will convert any image to grayscale, then binarize the image to only black and white pixes.  In grayscale images, every pixel represents an intensity value ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).  In black and white images, every pixel is either 0 or 255.  Intensity refers to the brightness of a color, white is the brightest and therefore the most intense, black is the darkest and the least intense.
